# API for my personal movie app project

Due to filtering issues, images from TMDB API couldn't be loaded in my country without VPN.
This is a fork from the original repo [imdb-api by Tuhin Kani Pal](https://github.com/tuhinpal/imdb-api).

Some additional features provided by TMDB API like popular movies and series, discover,... are added to this API.

Aside from movie information, I have also provided links to movies and series episodes in json format and can be found using ID or title, scraped from across different download websites.
